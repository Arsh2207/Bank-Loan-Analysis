### Project Overview

This project focused on analyzing bank loan data to uncover key performance indicators that help identifying loan distribution across different categories of customers. The analysis involved cleaning and preprocessing the dataset to handle missing values and outliers, followed by exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify patterns and trends. Data visualization techniques were employed to present findings clearly.

### Data Sources

The Datasets used for this project are "Finance1.csv" and "Finance2.csv" which contain the detailed information of the customers who have taken a loan from the bank

### Tools Used

- Excel - Data Cleaning
- MySQL - Data Analysis
- Tableau - Data Visualization and Dashboard creation

### Data Preparation

In the initial data preparation phase, the following steps were performed:
1. Data loading and inspection.
2. Handling missing values
3. Data cleaning and formatting

### Exploratory Data Analysis

EDA involved exploring the customer data to get Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) such as:
- Year wise loan amount Statistics.
- Garde wise Revolving Balance
- Payments done by Verified and Non-Verified Statuses
- State and month wise Loan Status
- Last payment date statistics by Homeownership

### Key Findings

- The loan amount issued has increased over the years
- The grade 'B' has the highest revolving balance
- The verified customers are regular in their loan payments
- The trend for loan payment of customers by their home-ownership was analysed

### Recommendations

- Steps should be taken to decrese the revolving balance of Grade-B customers
- The bank should focus on the Verified customers as they are regular in loan repayment
- Prepare for more loan completions and adjust strategies to handle increased cash flow
- Continue offering consistent loan products, as homeowners show steady repayment patterns
- Focus on creating attractive loan products for renters, and explore opportunities to offer additional financial services
